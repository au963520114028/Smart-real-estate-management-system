7. *Sprint Planning Meeting:* Hold a sprint planning meeting where the development team commits to completing the selected user stories and tasks. This meeting should involve discussions about the tasks, dependencies, and potential blockers.\par
\par
8. *Definition of Done:* Clearly define the "Definition of Done" criteria for each user story, ensuring that all team members have a shared understanding of what constitutes completion.\par
\par
*Estimation:*\par
\par
1. *Story Points:* Use a relative estimation technique like story points to assign a point value to each user story or task. Story points provide a measure of the overall effort required, but they don't directly equate to time.\par
\par
2. *Velocity:* Calculate the team's velocity, which is the number of story points the team can complete in a typical sprint. Velocity is a critical metric for future planning and estimation.\par
\par
3. *Time-Based Estimates:* Optionally, you can also provide time-based estimates (e.g., hours or days) for tasks. This can help in understanding the time frame for a sprint.\par
\par
4. *Consider Dependencies:* Take dependencies between tasks and user stories into account when estimating. Dependencies may impact the order in which tasks are tackled.\par
\par
5. *Buffer for Uncertainty:* Include a buffer for uncertainties and unexpected issues that may arise during the sprint.\par
\par
6. *Review and Adapt:* After the sprint, conduct a sprint review to evaluate how well the team's estimates aligned with actual work completed. Use this feedback to refine future estimations.\par
\par
Remember that agile practices encourage flexibility and adaptability. If the team encounters new information or changes in priorities during a sprint, they can adjust their plans accordingly.\par
\par
Sprint planning and estimation should be recurring activities, typically done at the beginning of each sprint, with continuous improvement and learning from past sprints. It's essential to maintain open communication and collaboration among team members throughout the process.\par
